## Topic: Computer Vision  
### Image Caption Generator

Nowadays, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing have taken a huge step forward due to major advancements in the field of Deep Learning and large volumes of data available. Different types of tasks like image classification, object detection, caption generator, sentiment analysis etc., which before were thought impossible, can now be solved by smart models and computers. 
Having always been fascinated by these two branches, I decided to concentrate for this project on the topic of `Image Captioning`, which actually lies at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing.
