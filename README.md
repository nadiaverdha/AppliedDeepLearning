## Topic: Computer Vision - Detection of Object - Pedestrian Detection

Nowadays, Computer Vision has taken a huge step forward due to major advancements in the field of Deep Learning. Having experienced object detection applications or heard about them in one way or another in my daily life, whether it's face recognition on my phone to reading articles about self driving cars, I have always found this topic very interesting. Therefore, I decided to concentrate on the task of pedestrian detection, a specialized area within the very broad field of object detection for my project.
