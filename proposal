PEDESTRIAN DETECTION


1st paper


F2DNET


two stage detectors - state of the art in the object detection as well as pedestrian detection, however, they are still

inefficient

f2dnet - a novel two stage-detection architecture which eliminates redundancy of current
two stage detectors by replacing the region proposal network with our focal detection network and boundinh
box head with our fast suppressio head
- different from existing single and two-stage detectors

Current two-stage object detection architectures employ a
weak region proposal network followed by strong bounding
box heads. We take a different approach and use a strong
detection head succeeded by a light suppression head (filtering out FP).
This may lead to faster computations.
